 * @mainpage Cub3D Project
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The Cub3D project is inspired by the game Wolfenstein 3D and allows users to explore ray-casting and create a dynamic view inside a maze. The project aims to improve skills in graphic design and basic algorithms while using mathematics as a tool to create efficient algorithms. The original game is recommended to be tested before starting the project.
 *
 * @section mandatory_sec Mandatory Part
 *
 * - Program name: cub3D
 * - Turn in files: Makefile, *.h, *.c
 * - Makefile: NAME, all, clean, fclean, re
 * - Arguments: A scene description file in format *.cub
 * - External functions: open, close, read, write, printf, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit, all functions of the math library (-lm compiler option, man man 3 math), all functions of the MiniLibX, ft_printf and any equivalent YOU coded
 * - Libft authorized: Yes
 *
 * Your project must comply with the following rules:
 *
 * - You must use the MiniLibX. Either the version available on the school machines or installing it using its sources.
 * - You have to turn in a Makefile which will compile your source files. It must not relink.
 * - Your program has to take as a parameter a scene description file ending with the .cub extension.
 *
 * @section bonus_sec Bonus Part
 *
 * Bonuses will be evaluated only if your mandatory part is PERFECT. By PERFECT we naturally mean that it needs to be complete, that it cannot fail, even in cases of nasty mistakes like wrong uses etc. It means that if your mandatory part does not obtain ALL the points during the grading, your bonuses will be entirely IGNORED.
 *
 * Bonus list:
 *
 * - Wall collisions.
 * - A minimap system.
 * - Doors which can open and close.
 * - Animated sprite.
 * - Rotate the point of view with the mouse.
 *
 * You will be able to create better games later do not waste too much time! You are allowed to use other functions or add symbols on the map to complete the bonus part as long as their use is justified during your evaluation. You are also allowed to modify the expected scene file format to fit your needs. Be smart!
